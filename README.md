# Aurora-simulation-framework
AuroraSim will be a modern C++ simulation framework that models heterogeneous entities using templates, type safe containers, and STL algorithms. The system will emphasize compile time correctness, zero cost abstractions, and clean separation of data and behavior. ( like the aurora northern lights, the Aurora Simulation Framework is made  from many simple/small particles that work together to create something complex and beautiful :) )
